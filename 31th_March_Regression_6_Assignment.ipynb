        "1.Problem Defination & Dataset Collection : First we formulate our problem defination and collect the data.This involves determining the objective of the application, identifying the relevant data sources, and collecting and cleaning the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Dataset Cleaning,Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering : Then we clean the data ie.remove outliers,fill null values and convert categorical to Numerical Datatypes and select only the relevent features for model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Model Training and Evaluation : This involves selecting an appropriate model, training the model on the data, and evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.The final model selected is then coverted to pickle file for further use in the web app.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Web Application Development : This involves building a web interface that allows users to input data, processing user inputs, and making predictions using the trained model.The pickled file embedded in the flask web app predicts based on the input data.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Cloud Deployment : This involves setting up the infrastructure on the cloud provider, configuring the application servers, and deploying the code. For example for deploying in AWS we use elastic beanstalk and codepipeline we add .eb extensions file.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Monitor and Maintain : Once the application is live, it's important to monitor it regularly to ensure it's performing as expected. This includes monitoring for errors, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Additionally, maintenance is required to ensure the application remains up-to-date with the latest security patches and features."

        "The difference between traditional web hosting and cloud hosting can be understood through several key aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Infrastructure\n",
        "\n",
        "(i)Traditional Web Hosting: Typically relies on a single physical server or a limited number of servers. Resources (CPU, RAM, storage) are fixed and tied to that server.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii)Cloud Hosting: Utilizes a network of virtual servers that draw resources from a larger pool of physical servers. This allows for more flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Scalability\n",
        "\n",
        "(i)Traditional Web Hosting: Scaling up usually requires upgrading the existing server or migrating to a more powerful server, which can be time-consuming and may involve downtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii)Cloud Hosting: Offers on-demand scalability, allowing you to easily increase or decrease resources based on traffic and usage without downtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Cost Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "(i)Traditional Web Hosting: Often involves a fixed monthly fee for a set amount of resources, regardless of actual usage. This can lead to overpaying for unused capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii)Cloud Hosting: Typically follows a pay-as-you-go model, where you only pay for the resources you use. This can be more cost-effective, especially for variable workloads.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.Reliability and Uptime\n",
        "\n",
        "(i)Traditional Web Hosting: If the physical server goes down, the website may become unavailable until the issue is resolved. Redundancy options may be limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii)Cloud Hosting: Offers higher reliability through redundancy and failover mechanisms. If one server fails, the workload can be automatically shifted to another server in the cloud network, minimizing downtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "(i)Traditional Web Hosting: Performance can be affected by the limitations of the single server, especially during traffic spikes.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii)Cloud Hosting: Can provide better performance by distributing the load across multiple servers, allowing for faster response times and handling of high traffic volumes.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Management and Maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "(i)Traditional Web Hosting: Often requires more hands-on management, including server maintenance, updates, and security.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii)Cloud Hosting: Many cloud providers offer managed services, which can reduce the burden of maintenance and allow developers to focus on building applications rather than managing infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.Flexibility\n",
        "\n",
        "(i)Traditional Web Hosting: Generally less flexible in terms of technology stack and configurations, as you are limited to the server's capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii)Cloud Hosting: Offers greater flexibility in choosing technologies, configurations, and deployment options, allowing for a more tailored solution."
